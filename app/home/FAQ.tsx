      question: "What are your pricing and project rates?",
      answer:
        "My rates vary based on project complexity and timeline. For web applications, projects typically range from $3,000-$15,000+ for small to medium applications, $15,000-$40,000+ for complex full-stack applications. Simple landing pages start at $800-$2,500, while e-commerce solutions range from $5,000-$20,000+. I offer both project-based pricing and hourly rates ($50-$100/hour depending on the work). Contact me for a detailed quote based on your specific requirements.",

A simple landing page takes 1-2 weeks, a basic web application takes 3-6 weeks, complex full-stack applications take 2-4 months, and enterprise-level solutions can take 4-6 months. For MVPs, I can typically deliver a working product in 3-8 weeks. I provide detailed project timelines during our initial consultation and keep you updated throughout the development process.",
